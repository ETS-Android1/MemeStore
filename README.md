# MemeStore (Pre Release)
My First Android Application


How this app is build :-

This is a Simple app which shows random memes. 

The memes are fetched through JSON based API Heroku (Link for the API - https://meme-api.herokuapp.com/gimme) and the GET request  is send through the VOLLEY Library. 
After the URL is fetched, Glide library is used to  set the image over the ImageView.
In Additions, Some animations are added through Lottie Library.
